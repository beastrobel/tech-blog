# Tech Blog

## Description

The challenge was to create a tech blog, where the user is able to sign up, log in, create posts, delete posts, and view community posts. I used a MySQL database and sequelize models to store the data. I used express js and express sessions to program the routes for the blog, and to store user sessions. I created GET, POST, and DELETE routes for the blog posts. Bcrypt was used to encrypt the passwords for an added layer of security. 


## Usage

To use the tech blog, visit https://tech-blog-42-62e93e33c17a.herokuapp.com/. Sign up, log in, write posts, delete posts, and view community posts.
